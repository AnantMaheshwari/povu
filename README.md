# povu
Find regions of variation in a variation graph


## Install

### Compile from source

1. Fetch the source code
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/urbanslug/povu.git
```

2. Compile
```
cmake -H. -Bbuild && cmake --build build -- -j 3
```

3. The binary should be in `./bin/povu`


## Usage

For general help text run `./bin/povu -h` or just `./bin/povu`


### Deconstruct

**help:** `./bin/povu deconstruct -h`

For any graph, the `deconstruct` sub-command generates the flubble forest: a set of flubble trees. Currently, each flubble tree is stored in its own flubble file.

Example 1.
Lines starting with `#` are comments
```
# create an output directory
mkdir results/

# run povu on the yeast dataset
./bin/povu deconstruct -v 0 -i ./test_data/cerevisiae.fa.gz.d1a145e.417fcdf.7493449.smooth.final.gfa -o results
```

Currently hairpin boundaries are printed by `povu deconstruct` at runtime, if none is printed then none was found.


## Flubble Tree

A tree representation of the hierarchy and nesting relationship between flubbles

#### flb Format

The flb format is a plain-text file representing flubble tree(s) and ends with the `.flb` extension. It is tab-separated and consists of 3 columns where a dot `.` represents a null value.
Below is a table with the specifics of each column.

| column    | type             | description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| vertex id | unsigned numeric | A unique identifier (can be zero & cannot be null).                                                                                                                                           |
| range     | string           | The start & end vertices, as well as their strand. <br> Null in dummy vertices. <br> For example, `>4946,>4948` refers to a flubble starting at 4946 and ending at 4948 in the forward strand. |
| children  | string           | A comma seperated string of unsigned integers which are the child vertices <br> Null if the vertex is a leaf.                                                                                 |



## Input
Input GFA

Expect the segments in the input GFA to have unique numeric [segment names](https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec/blob/master/GFA1.md#s-segment-line).


## Development

To compile povu with debug symbols and with address sanitizer

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DUSE_SANITIZER=address  -H. -Bbuild && cmake --build build -- -j 3
```

## Name

The etymology of the name is rooted in profound philosophy ðŸ¤”. "Povu," is [Kiswahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language) for "foam." Foam, by nature, comprises countless flubbles.
